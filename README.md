# Twitter data basics

Connect to Twitter’s API using Mike Kearney’s ‘rtweet’ package. Collect tweets via keywords, from a specific geographic location, or from a specific user’s timeline. 
Also do some basic plotting to explore data like geo-maps and a word cloud. 
Important: this script assumes you have a Twitter developer account, which you can easily set up following [this tutorial](https://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html).
